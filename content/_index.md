# TinyGo - A Go Compiler For Small Places

TinyGo is a project to bring the [Go programming language](https://golang.org) to microcontrollers and modern web browsers by creating a new compiler based on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

You can compile and run TinyGo programs on several different microcontroller boards such as the [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk/) and the [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3/).

TinyGo can also be used to produce [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/) code which is very compact in size.

Just want to see the code? Go to the Github repository at [https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo).

TinyGo also has support for several different devices such as accelerometers and magnetometers. Check out the Github repository at [https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers) for more information.
