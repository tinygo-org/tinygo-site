    Resources for using TinyGo for embedded development
---

Here are some of the "official" packages and resources in the TinyGo ecosystem that you can use for creating embedded programs.

[I want to use sensors connected to my device](#sensors)

[I want to use a display connected to my device](#displays)

[I want to make a wireless connection with my device](#sensors)

[I want to store data on my device](#sensors)

There are also other great resources in the community. You can find some of them in the "Awesome TinyGo" repository:

## Sensors

Check out the TinyGo Drivers repository for many different kinds of sensors that you can use from your TinyGo programs:

## Displays

There are a number of displays you can connect via SPI or parallel interfaces and then use from your TinyGo programs.

See the TinyGo Drivers repository for some of the supported display devices:
