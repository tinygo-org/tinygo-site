The [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) is small ARM development board based on the Atmel [SAMD21](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMD21G18) family of processors. It has several built-in devices such as WS2812 "NeoPixel" LEDs, buttons, an accelerometer, and some other sensors.

## Flashing

### UF2

The Circuit Playground Express comes with the [UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2) already installed.

### CLI Flashing

- Plug your Circuit Playground Express into your computer's USB port.
- Flash your TinyGo program to the board using this command:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=circuitplay-express [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

- The Circuit Playground Express board should restart and then begin running your program.

### Troubleshooting

If you have troubles getting your Circuit Playground Express board to receive code, try this:

- Press the "RESET" button on the board two times to get the Circuit Playground Express board ready to receive code.
- The Circuit Playground Express board will appear to your computer like a USB drive.
- Now try running the command:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=circuitplay-express [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

Once you have updated your Circuit Playground Express board the first time, after that you should be able to flash it entirely from the command line.

## Notes

You can use the USB port to the Circuit Playground Express as a serial port. `UART0` refers to this connection.

For an example that uses the built-in Neopixel LEDs, take a look at the TinyGo drivers repository located at [https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/examples](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers)
