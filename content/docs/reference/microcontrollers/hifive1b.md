## Flashing

### MSD Flashing

The HiFive1 RevB comes with a bootloader that allows Mass Storage Device (MSD) flashing. This means you can just copy the compiled `.hex` file generated by TinyGo onto it, no additional flashing software is needed.

- Plug your HiFive1 RevB into your computer's USB port.

- The HiFive1 RevB board will appear to your computer like a USB drive.

- Build and flash your TinyGo program using `tinygo flash` like this:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=hifive1b [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

- The HiFive1 RevB should restart and begin running your program.
