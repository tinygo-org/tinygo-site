## Flashing

### OpenOCD

Programs are loaded onto the LoRa-E5 with an STLink hardware programmer, using the `openocd` command line utility program to perform the board flashing. You must install [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/) before you will be able to flash the LoRa-E5 board with your TinyGo code.

- Connect an ST-Link device to the SWD/SWIM headers.
- Plug your LoRa-E5 board into your computer's USB port.
- Plug your ST-Link device into your computer's USB port.
- Build and flash your TinyGo program using `tinygo flash -target=lorae5`
