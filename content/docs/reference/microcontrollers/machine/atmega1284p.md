## Constants

```go
const (
	TWI_FREQ_100KHZ	= 100000
	TWI_FREQ_400KHZ	= 400000
)
```

TWI_FREQ is the I2C bus speed. Normally either 100 kHz, or 400 kHz for high-speed bus.


```go
const NoPin = Pin(0xff)

NoPin explicitly indicates "not a pin". Use this pin if you want to leave one
of the pins in a peripheral unconfigured (if supported by the hardware).

)
```






### func CPUFrequency

```go
func CPUFrequency() uint32
```

Return the current CPU frequency in hertz.


### func InitADC

```go
func InitADC()
```

InitADC initializes the registers needed for ADC.


### func NewRingBuffer

```go
func NewRingBuffer() *RingBuffer
```

NewRingBuffer returns a new ring buffer.




## type ADC

```go
type ADC struct {
	Pin Pin
}
```




### func (ADC) Configure

```go
func (a ADC) Configure(ADCConfig)
```

Configure configures a ADCPin to be able to be used to read data.


### func (ADC) Get

```go
func (a ADC) Get() uint16
```

Get returns the current value of a ADC pin, in the range 0..0xffff. The AVR
has an ADC of 10 bits precision so the lower 6 bits will be zero.




## type ADCConfig

```go
type ADCConfig struct {
	Reference	uint32	// analog reference voltage (AREF) in millivolts
	Resolution	uint32	// number of bits for a single conversion (e.g., 8, 10, 12)
	Samples		uint32	// number of samples for a single conversion (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 32)
}
```

ADCConfig holds ADC configuration parameters. If left unspecified, the zero
value of each parameter will use the peripheral's default settings.





## type I2C

```go
type I2C struct {
}
```

I2C on AVR.



### func (I2C) Configure

```go
func (i2c I2C) Configure(config I2CConfig) error
```

Configure is intended to setup the I2C interface.


### func (I2C) ReadRegister

```go
func (i2c I2C) ReadRegister(address uint8, register uint8, data []byte) error
```

ReadRegister transmits the register, restarts the connection as a read
operation, and reads the response.

Many I2C-compatible devices are organized in terms of registers. This method
is a shortcut to easily read such registers. Also, it only works for devices
with 7-bit addresses, which is the vast majority.


### func (I2C) Tx

```go
func (i2c I2C) Tx(addr uint16, w, r []byte) error
```

Tx does a single I2C transaction at the specified address.
It clocks out the given address, writes the bytes in w, reads back len(r)
bytes and stores them in r, and generates a stop condition on the bus.


### func (I2C) WriteRegister

```go
func (i2c I2C) WriteRegister(address uint8, register uint8, data []byte) error
```

WriteRegister transmits first the register and then the data to the
peripheral device.

Many I2C-compatible devices are organized in terms of registers. This method
is a shortcut to easily write to such registers. Also, it only works for
devices with 7-bit addresses, which is the vast majority.




## type I2CConfig

type I2CConfig struct {
	Frequency uint32
}
```

I2CConfig is used to store config info for I2C.





## type PWM

```go
type PWM struct {
	Pin Pin
}
```






## type Pin

```go
type Pin uint8
```

Pin is a single pin on a chip, which may be connected to other hardware
devices. It can either be used directly as GPIO pin or it can be used in
other peripherals like ADC, I2C, etc.



### func (Pin) Configure

```go
func (p Pin) Configure(config PinConfig)
```

Configure sets the pin to input or output.

```

Get returns the current value of a GPIO pin.


### func (Pin) High

```go
func (p Pin) High()
```

High sets this GPIO pin to high, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to high that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) Low

```go
func (p Pin) Low()
```

Low sets this GPIO pin to low, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to low that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) PortMaskClear

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskClear() (*volatile.Register8, uint8)
```

Return the register and mask to disable a given port. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.

Warning: there are no separate pin set/clear registers on the AVR. The
returned mask is only valid as long as no other pin in the same port has been
changed.


### func (Pin) PortMaskSet

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskSet() (*volatile.Register8, uint8)
```

Return the register and mask to enable a given GPIO pin. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.

Warning: there are no separate pin set/clear registers on the AVR. The
returned mask is only valid as long as no other pin in the same port has been
changed.


### func (Pin) Set

```go
func (p Pin) Set(value bool)
```

Set changes the value of the GPIO pin. The pin must be configured as output.




## type PinConfig

type PinConfig struct {
	Mode PinMode
}
```






## type PinMode

```go
type PinMode uint8
```






## type RingBuffer

```go
type RingBuffer struct {
	rxbuffer	[bufferSize]volatile.Register8
	head		volatile.Register8
	tail		volatile.Register8
}
```

RingBuffer is ring buffer implementation inspired by post at
https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showthread/comp.arch.embedded/77084-1.php



### func (*RingBuffer) Clear

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Clear()
```

Clear resets the head and tail pointer to zero.


### func (*RingBuffer) Get

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Get() (byte, bool)
```

Get returns a byte from the buffer. If the buffer is empty,
the method will return a false as the second value.


### func (*RingBuffer) Put

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Put(val byte) bool
```

Put stores a byte in the buffer. If the buffer is already
full, the method will return false.


### func (*RingBuffer) Used

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Used() uint8
```

Used returns how many bytes in buffer have been used.




## type SPI

```go
type SPI struct {
	// The registers for the SPIx port set by the chip
	spcr	*volatile.Register8
	spdr	*volatile.Register8
	spsr	*volatile.Register8

	// The io pins for the SPIx port set by the chip
	sck	Pin
	sdi	Pin
	sdo	Pin
	cs	Pin
}
```

SPI is for the Serial Peripheral Interface
Data is taken from http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATmega48A-PA-88A-PA-168A-PA-328-P-DS-DS40002061A.pdf page 169 and following



### func (SPI) Configure

```go
func (s SPI) Configure(config SPIConfig) error
```

Configure is intended to setup the SPI interface.


### func (SPI) Transfer

```go
func (s SPI) Transfer(b byte) (byte, error)
```

Transfer writes the byte into the register and returns the read content


### func (SPI) Tx

```go
func (spi SPI) Tx(w, r []byte) error
```

Tx handles read/write operation for SPI interface. Since SPI is a syncronous write/read
interface, there must always be the same number of bytes written as bytes read.
The Tx method knows about this, and offers a few different ways of calling it.

This form sends the bytes in tx buffer, putting the resulting bytes read into the rx buffer.
Note that the tx and rx buffers must be the same size:

		spi.Tx(tx, rx)

This form sends the tx buffer, ignoring the result. Useful for sending "commands" that return zeros
until all the bytes in the command packet have been received:

		spi.Tx(tx, nil)

This form sends zeros, putting the result into the rx buffer. Good for reading a "result packet":

		spi.Tx(nil, rx)




## type SPIConfig

```go
type SPIConfig struct {
	Frequency	uint32
	LSBFirst	bool
	Mode		uint8
}
```

SPIConfig is used to store config info for SPI.
