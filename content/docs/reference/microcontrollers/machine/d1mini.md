## Constants

```go
const (
	D0	Pin	= 16
	D1	Pin	= 5
	D2	Pin	= 4
	D3	Pin	= 0
	D4	Pin	= 2
	D5	Pin	= 14
	D6	Pin	= 12
	D7	Pin	= 13
	D8	Pin	= 15
)
```

GPIO pins on the NodeMCU board.


```go
const LED = D4
```

Onboard blue LED (on the AI-Thinker module).


```go
const (
	SPI0_SCK_PIN	= D5
	SPI0_SDO_PIN	= D7
	SPI0_SDI_PIN	= D6
	SPI0_CS0_PIN	= D8
)
```

SPI pins


```go
const (
	SDA_PIN	= D2
	SCL_PIN	= D1
)
```

I2C pins


```go
const Device = deviceName
```

Device is the running program's chip name, such as "ATSAMD51J19A" or
"nrf52840". It is not the same as the CPU name.

The constant is some hardcoded default value if the program does not target a
particular chip but instead runs in WebAssembly for example.


```go
const NoPin = Pin(0xff)
```

NoPin explicitly indicates "not a pin". Use this pin if you want to leave one
of the pins in a peripheral unconfigured (if supported by the hardware).


```go
const (
	PinOutput	PinMode	= iota
	PinInput
)
```



```go
const (
	UART_TX_PIN	Pin	= 1
	UART_RX_PIN	Pin	= 3
)
```

Pins that are fixed by the chip.


```go
const (
	// ParityNone means to not use any parity checking. This is
	// the most common setting.
	ParityNone	UARTParity	= 0

	// ParityEven means to expect that the total number of 1 bits sent
	// should be an even number.
	ParityEven	UARTParity	= 1

	// ParityOdd means to expect that the total number of 1 bits sent
	// should be an odd number.
	ParityOdd	UARTParity	= 2
)
```






## Variables

```go
var (
	ErrTimeoutRNG		= errors.New("machine: RNG Timeout")
	ErrInvalidInputPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid input pin")
	ErrInvalidOutputPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid output pin")
	ErrInvalidClockPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid clock pin")
	ErrInvalidDataPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid data pin")
	ErrNoPinChangeChannel	= errors.New("machine: no channel available for pin interrupt")
)
```



```go
var DefaultUART = UART0
```



```go
var UART0 = &_UART0
```

UART0 is a hardware UART that supports both TX and RX.


```go
var (
	ErrPWMPeriodTooLong = errors.New("pwm: period too long")
)
```



```go
var Serial = DefaultUART
```

Serial is implemented via the default (usually the first) UART on the chip.





### func CPUFrequency

```go
func CPUFrequency() uint32
```



### func InitSerial

```go
func InitSerial()
```



### func NewRingBuffer

```go
func NewRingBuffer() *RingBuffer
```

NewRingBuffer returns a new ring buffer.




## type ADC

```go
type ADC struct {
	Pin Pin
}
```






## type ADCConfig

```go
type ADCConfig struct {
	Reference	uint32	// analog reference voltage (AREF) in millivolts
	Resolution	uint32	// number of bits for a single conversion (e.g., 8, 10, 12)
	Samples		uint32	// number of samples for a single conversion (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 32)
}
```

ADCConfig holds ADC configuration parameters. If left unspecified, the zero
value of each parameter will use the peripheral's default settings.





## type NullSerial

```go
type NullSerial struct {
}
```

NullSerial is a serial version of /dev/null (or null router): it drops
everything that is written to it.



### func (NullSerial) Buffered

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Buffered() int
```

Buffered returns how many bytes are buffered in the UART. It always returns 0
as there are no bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Configure

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Configure(config UARTConfig) error
```

Configure does nothing: the null serial has no configuration.


### func (NullSerial) ReadByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```

ReadByte always returns an error because there aren't any bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Write

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write is a no-op: none of the data is being written and it will not return an
error.


### func (NullSerial) WriteByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) WriteByte(b byte) error
```

WriteByte is a no-op: the null serial doesn't write bytes.




## type PWMConfig

```go
type PWMConfig struct {
	// PWM period in nanosecond. Leaving this zero will pick a reasonable period
	// value for use with LEDs.
	// If you want to configure a frequency instead of a period, you can use the
	// following formula to calculate a period from a frequency:
	//
	//     period = 1e9 / frequency
	//
	Period uint64
}
```

PWMConfig allows setting some configuration while configuring a PWM
peripheral. A zero PWMConfig is ready to use for simple applications such as
dimming LEDs.





## type Pin

```go
type Pin uint8
```

Pin is a single pin on a chip, which may be connected to other hardware
devices. It can either be used directly as GPIO pin or it can be used in
other peripherals like ADC, I2C, etc.



### func (Pin) Configure

```go
func (p Pin) Configure(config PinConfig)
```

Configure sets the given pin as output or input pin.


### func (Pin) Get

```go
func (p Pin) Get() bool
```

Get returns the current value of a GPIO pin when the pin is configured as an
input or as an output.


### func (Pin) High

```go
func (p Pin) High()
```

High sets this GPIO pin to high, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to high that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) Low

```go
func (p Pin) Low()
```

Low sets this GPIO pin to low, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to low that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) PortMaskClear

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskClear() (*uint32, uint32)
```

Return the register and mask to disable a given GPIO pin. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.

Warning: only use this on an output pin!


### func (Pin) PortMaskSet

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskSet() (*uint32, uint32)
```

Return the register and mask to enable a given GPIO pin. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.

Warning: only use this on an output pin!


### func (Pin) Set

```go
func (p Pin) Set(value bool)
```

Set sets the output value of this pin to high (true) or low (false).




## type PinConfig

```go
type PinConfig struct {
	Mode PinMode
}
```






## type PinMode

```go
type PinMode uint8
```

PinMode sets the direction and pull mode of the pin. For example, PinOutput
sets the pin as an output and PinInputPullup sets the pin as an input with a
pull-up.





## type RingBuffer

```go
type RingBuffer struct {
	rxbuffer	[bufferSize]volatile.Register8
	head		volatile.Register8
	tail		volatile.Register8
}
```

RingBuffer is ring buffer implementation inspired by post at
https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showthread/comp.arch.embedded/77084-1.php



### func (*RingBuffer) Clear

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Clear()
```

Clear resets the head and tail pointer to zero.


### func (*RingBuffer) Get

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Get() (byte, bool)
```

Get returns a byte from the buffer. If the buffer is empty,
the method will return a false as the second value.


### func (*RingBuffer) Put

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Put(val byte) bool
```

Put stores a byte in the buffer. If the buffer is already
full, the method will return false.


### func (*RingBuffer) Used

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Used() uint8
```

Used returns how many bytes in buffer have been used.




## type UART

```go
type UART struct {
	Buffer *RingBuffer
}
```




### func (*UART) Buffered

```go
func (uart *UART) Buffered() int
```

Buffered returns the number of bytes currently stored in the RX buffer.


### func (*UART) Configure

```go
func (uart *UART) Configure(config UARTConfig)
```

Configure the UART baud rate. TX and RX pins are fixed by the hardware so
cannot be modified and will be ignored.


### func (*UART) Read

```go
func (uart *UART) Read(data []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Read from the RX buffer.


### func (*UART) ReadByte

```go
func (uart *UART) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```

ReadByte reads a single byte from the RX buffer.
If there is no data in the buffer, returns an error.


### func (*UART) Receive

```go
func (uart *UART) Receive(data byte)
```

Receive handles adding data to the UART's data buffer.
Usually called by the IRQ handler for a machine.


### func (*UART) Write

```go
func (uart *UART) Write(data []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write data to the UART.


### func (*UART) WriteByte

```go
func (uart *UART) WriteByte(c byte) error
```

WriteByte writes a single byte to the output buffer. Note that the hardware
includes a buffer of 128 bytes which will be used first.




## type UARTConfig

```go
type UARTConfig struct {
	BaudRate	uint32
	TX		Pin
	RX		Pin
}
```

UARTConfig is a struct with which a UART (or similar object) can be
configured. The baud rate is usually respected, but TX and RX may be ignored
depending on the chip and the type of object.





## type UARTParity

```go
type UARTParity int
```

UARTParity is the parity setting to be used for UART communication.
