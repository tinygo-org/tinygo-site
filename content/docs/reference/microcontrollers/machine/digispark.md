## Constants

```go
const (
	P0	Pin	= PB0
	P1	Pin	= PB1
	P2	Pin	= PB2
	P3	Pin	= PB3
	P4	Pin	= PB4
	P5	Pin	= PB5

	LED	= P1
)
```



```go
const Device = deviceName
```

Device is the running program's chip name, such as "ATSAMD51J19A" or
"nrf52840". It is not the same as the CPU name.

The constant is some hardcoded default value if the program does not target a
particular chip but instead runs in WebAssembly for example.


```go
const (
	KHz	= 1000
	MHz	= 1000_000
	GHz	= 1000_000_000
)
```

Generic constants.


```go
const NoPin = Pin(0xff)
```

NoPin explicitly indicates "not a pin". Use this pin if you want to leave one
of the pins in a peripheral unconfigured (if supported by the hardware).


```go
const (
	PB0	Pin	= iota
	PB1
	PB2
	PB3
	PB4
	PB5
)
```



```go
const (
	PinInput	PinMode	= iota
	PinInputPullup
	PinOutput
)
```






## Variables

```go
var (
	ErrTimeoutRNG		= errors.New("machine: RNG Timeout")
	ErrClockRNG		= errors.New("machine: RNG Clock Error")
	ErrSeedRNG		= errors.New("machine: RNG Seed Error")
	ErrInvalidInputPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid input pin")
	ErrInvalidOutputPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid output pin")
	ErrInvalidClockPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid clock pin")
	ErrInvalidDataPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid data pin")
	ErrNoPinChangeChannel	= errors.New("machine: no channel available for pin interrupt")
)
```



```go
var (
	ErrPWMPeriodTooLong = errors.New("pwm: period too long")
)
```



```go
var Serial = NullSerial{}
```

Serial is a null device: writes to it are ignored.





### func CPUFrequency

```go
func CPUFrequency() uint32
```

Return the current CPU frequency in hertz.


### func InitADC

```go
func InitADC()
```

InitADC initializes the registers needed for ADC.


### func InitSerial

```go
func InitSerial()
```



### func NewRingBuffer

```go
func NewRingBuffer() *RingBuffer
```

NewRingBuffer returns a new ring buffer.




## type ADC

```go
type ADC struct {
	Pin Pin
}
```




### func (ADC) Configure

```go
func (a ADC) Configure(ADCConfig)
```

Configure configures a ADCPin to be able to be used to read data.


### func (ADC) Get

```go
func (a ADC) Get() uint16
```

Get returns the current value of a ADC pin, in the range 0..0xffff. The AVR
has an ADC of 10 bits precision so the lower 6 bits will be zero.




## type ADCConfig

```go
type ADCConfig struct {
	Reference	uint32	// analog reference voltage (AREF) in millivolts
	Resolution	uint32	// number of bits for a single conversion (e.g., 8, 10, 12)
	Samples		uint32	// number of samples for a single conversion (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 32)
	SampleTime	uint32	// sample time, in microseconds (µs)
}
```

ADCConfig holds ADC configuration parameters. If left unspecified, the zero
value of each parameter will use the peripheral's default settings.





## type NullSerial

```go
type NullSerial struct {
}
```

NullSerial is a serial version of /dev/null (or null router): it drops
everything that is written to it.



### func (NullSerial) Buffered

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Buffered() int
```

Buffered returns how many bytes are buffered in the UART. It always returns 0
as there are no bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Configure

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Configure(config UARTConfig) error
```

Configure does nothing: the null serial has no configuration.


### func (NullSerial) ReadByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```

ReadByte always returns an error because there aren't any bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Write

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write is a no-op: none of the data is being written and it will not return an
error.


### func (NullSerial) WriteByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) WriteByte(b byte) error
```

WriteByte is a no-op: the null serial doesn't write bytes.




## type PDMConfig

```go
type PDMConfig struct {
	Stereo	bool
	DIN	Pin
	CLK	Pin
}
```






## type PWMConfig

```go
type PWMConfig struct {
	// PWM period in nanosecond. Leaving this zero will pick a reasonable period
	// value for use with LEDs.
	// If you want to configure a frequency instead of a period, you can use the
	// following formula to calculate a period from a frequency:
	//
	//     period = 1e9 / frequency
	//
	Period uint64
}
```

PWMConfig allows setting some configuration while configuring a PWM
peripheral. A zero PWMConfig is ready to use for simple applications such as
dimming LEDs.





## type Pin

```go
type Pin uint8
```

Pin is a single pin on a chip, which may be connected to other hardware
devices. It can either be used directly as GPIO pin or it can be used in
other peripherals like ADC, I2C, etc.



### func (Pin) Configure

```go
func (p Pin) Configure(config PinConfig)
```

Configure sets the pin to input or output.


### func (Pin) Get

```go
func (p Pin) Get() bool
```

Get returns the current value of a GPIO pin when the pin is configured as an
input or as an output.


### func (Pin) High

```go
func (p Pin) High()
```

High sets this GPIO pin to high, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to high that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) Low

```go
func (p Pin) Low()
```

Low sets this GPIO pin to low, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to low that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) PortMaskClear

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskClear() (*volatile.Register8, uint8)
```

Return the register and mask to disable a given port. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.

Warning: there are no separate pin set/clear registers on the AVR. The
returned mask is only valid as long as no other pin in the same port has been
changed.


### func (Pin) PortMaskSet

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskSet() (*volatile.Register8, uint8)
```

Return the register and mask to enable a given GPIO pin. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.

Warning: there are no separate pin set/clear registers on the AVR. The
returned mask is only valid as long as no other pin in the same port has been
changed.


### func (Pin) Set

```go
func (p Pin) Set(value bool)
```

Set changes the value of the GPIO pin. The pin must be configured as output.




## type PinConfig

```go
type PinConfig struct {
	Mode PinMode
}
```






## type PinMode

```go
type PinMode uint8
```

PinMode sets the direction and pull mode of the pin. For example, PinOutput
sets the pin as an output and PinInputPullup sets the pin as an input with a
pull-up.





## type RingBuffer

```go
type RingBuffer struct {
	rxbuffer	[bufferSize]volatile.Register8
	head		volatile.Register8
	tail		volatile.Register8
}
```

RingBuffer is ring buffer implementation inspired by post at
https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showthread/comp.arch.embedded/77084-1.php



### func (*RingBuffer) Clear

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Clear()
```

Clear resets the head and tail pointer to zero.


### func (*RingBuffer) Get

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Get() (byte, bool)
```

Get returns a byte from the buffer. If the buffer is empty,
the method will return a false as the second value.


### func (*RingBuffer) Put

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Put(val byte) bool
```

Put stores a byte in the buffer. If the buffer is already
full, the method will return false.


### func (*RingBuffer) Used

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Used() uint8
```

Used returns how many bytes in buffer have been used.




## type UARTConfig

```go
type UARTConfig struct {
	BaudRate	uint32
	TX		Pin
	RX		Pin
	RTS		Pin
	CTS		Pin
}
```

UARTConfig is a struct with which a UART (or similar object) can be
configured. The baud rate is usually respected, but TX and RX may be ignored
depending on the chip and the type of object.
