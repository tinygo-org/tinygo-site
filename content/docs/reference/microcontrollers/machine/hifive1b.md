	LED2		= LED_GREEN
	LED3		= LED_BLUE
	LED_RED		= P22
	LED_GREEN	= P19

)
```



```go
const (
	// TODO: figure out the pin numbers for these.
	UART_TX_PIN	= D1
	UART_RX_PIN	= D0
)
```



```go
const (
	SPI0_SCK_PIN	= NoPin
	SPI0_SDO_PIN	= NoPin

SPI pins


```go
const (
	I2C0_SDA_PIN	= D18
	I2C0_SCL_PIN	= D19
)
```

I2C pins


```go
const (
	TWI_FREQ_100KHZ	= 100000
	TWI_FREQ_400KHZ	= 400000
)
```

TWI_FREQ is the I2C bus speed. Normally either 100 kHz, or 400 kHz for high-speed bus.

Deprecated: use 100 * machine.KHz or 400 * machine.KHz instead.


```go
const Device = deviceName
```

Device is the running program's chip name, such as "ATSAMD51J19A" or
"nrf52840". It is not the same as the CPU name.

The constant is some hardcoded default value if the program does not target a
particular chip but instead runs in WebAssembly for example.


```go
const (
	KHz	= 1000
	MHz	= 1000_000
	GHz	= 1000_000_000
)
```

Generic constants.


```go
const NoPin = Pin(0xff)
```

NoPin explicitly indicates "not a pin". Use this pin if you want to leave one
of the pins in a peripheral unconfigured (if supported by the hardware).


```go
const (
	PinInput	PinMode	= iota
	PinOutput
	PinPWM
	PinSPI
	PinI2C	= PinSPI
)
```

	Mode0	= 0
	Mode1	= 1
	Mode2	= 2
	Mode3	= 3
)
```

```go
const (
	// ParityNone means to not use any parity checking. This is
	// the most common setting.
	ParityNone	UARTParity	= iota

	// ParityEven means to expect that the total number of 1 bits sent
	// should be an even number.
	ParityEven

	// ParityOdd means to expect that the total number of 1 bits sent
	// should be an odd number.
	ParityOdd
)
```

	I2C0 = (*I2C)(unsafe.Pointer(sifive.I2C0))
)
```



```go
var (
	ErrPWMPeriodTooLong = errors.New("pwm: period too long")
)
```



```go
var Serial = DefaultUART
```

Serial is implemented via the default (usually the first) UART on the chip.


```go
var (
	ErrTxInvalidSliceSize		= errors.New("SPI write and read slices must be same size")
	errSPIInvalidMachineConfig	= errors.New("SPI port was not configured properly by the machine")
)
```






### func CPUFrequency

```go
func CPUFrequency() uint32
```



### func InitSerial

```go
func InitSerial()
```



### func NewRingBuffer

```go
func NewRingBuffer() *RingBuffer
```

NewRingBuffer returns a new ring buffer.




## type ADC

```go
type ADC struct {
	Pin Pin
}
```






## type ADCConfig

```go
type ADCConfig struct {
	Reference	uint32	// analog reference voltage (AREF) in millivolts
	Resolution	uint32	// number of bits for a single conversion (e.g., 8, 10, 12)
	Samples		uint32	// number of samples for a single conversion (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 32)
}
```

ADCConfig holds ADC configuration parameters. If left unspecified, the zero
value of each parameter will use the peripheral's default settings.





## type I2C

```go
type I2C struct {
	Bus sifive.I2C_Type
}
```

I2C on the FE310-G002.



### func (*I2C) Configure

```go
func (i2c *I2C) Configure(config I2CConfig) error
```

Configure is intended to setup the I2C interface.


### func (*I2C) ReadRegister

```go
func (i2c *I2C) ReadRegister(address uint8, register uint8, data []byte) error
```

ReadRegister transmits the register, restarts the connection as a read
operation, and reads the response.

Many I2C-compatible devices are organized in terms of registers. This method
is a shortcut to easily read such registers. Also, it only works for devices
with 7-bit addresses, which is the vast majority.


### func (*I2C) Tx

```go
func (i2c *I2C) Tx(addr uint16, w, r []byte) error
```

Tx does a single I2C transaction at the specified address.
It clocks out the given address, writes the bytes in w, reads back len(r)
bytes and stores them in r, and generates a stop condition on the bus.


### func (*I2C) WriteRegister

```go
func (i2c *I2C) WriteRegister(address uint8, register uint8, data []byte) error
```

WriteRegister transmits first the register and then the data to the
peripheral device.

Many I2C-compatible devices are organized in terms of registers. This method
is a shortcut to easily write to such registers. Also, it only works for
devices with 7-bit addresses, which is the vast majority.




## type I2CConfig

```go
type I2CConfig struct {
	Frequency	uint32
	SCL		Pin
	SDA		Pin
}
```

I2CConfig is used to store config info for I2C.





## type NullSerial

```go
type NullSerial struct {
}
```

NullSerial is a serial version of /dev/null (or null router): it drops
everything that is written to it.



### func (NullSerial) Buffered

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Buffered() int
```

Buffered returns how many bytes are buffered in the UART. It always returns 0
as there are no bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Configure

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Configure(config UARTConfig) error
```

Configure does nothing: the null serial has no configuration.


### func (NullSerial) ReadByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```

ReadByte always returns an error because there aren't any bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Write

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write is a no-op: none of the data is being written and it will not return an
error.


### func (NullSerial) WriteByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) WriteByte(b byte) error
```

WriteByte is a no-op: the null serial doesn't write bytes.




## type PWMConfig

```go
type PWMConfig struct {
	// PWM period in nanosecond. Leaving this zero will pick a reasonable period
	// value for use with LEDs.
	// If you want to configure a frequency instead of a period, you can use the
	// following formula to calculate a period from a frequency:
	//
	//     period = 1e9 / frequency
	//
	Period uint64
}
```

PWMConfig allows setting some configuration while configuring a PWM
peripheral. A zero PWMConfig is ready to use for simple applications such as
dimming LEDs.





## type Pin

```go
type Pin uint8
```

Pin is a single pin on a chip, which may be connected to other hardware
devices. It can either be used directly as GPIO pin or it can be used in
other peripherals like ADC, I2C, etc.



### func (Pin) Configure

```go
func (p Pin) Configure(config PinConfig)
```

Configure this pin with the given configuration.


### func (Pin) Get

```go
func (p Pin) Get() bool
```

Get returns the current value of a GPIO pin when the pin is configured as an
input or as an output.


### func (Pin) High

```go
func (p Pin) High()
```

High sets this GPIO pin to high, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to high that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) Low

```go
func (p Pin) Low()
```

Low sets this GPIO pin to low, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to low that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) PortMaskClear

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskClear() (*uint32, uint32)
```

Return the register and mask to disable a given GPIO pin. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.

Warning: only use this on an output pin!


### func (Pin) PortMaskSet

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskSet() (*uint32, uint32)
```

Return the register and mask to enable a given GPIO pin. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.

Warning: only use this on an output pin!


### func (Pin) Set

```go
func (p Pin) Set(high bool)
```

Set the pin to high or low.




## type PinConfig

```go
type PinConfig struct {
	Mode PinMode
}
```






## type PinMode

```go
type PinMode uint8
```

PinMode sets the direction and pull mode of the pin. For example, PinOutput
sets the pin as an output and PinInputPullup sets the pin as an input with a
pull-up.





## type RingBuffer

```go
type RingBuffer struct {
	rxbuffer	[bufferSize]volatile.Register8
	head		volatile.Register8
	tail		volatile.Register8
}
```

RingBuffer is ring buffer implementation inspired by post at
https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showthread/comp.arch.embedded/77084-1.php



### func (*RingBuffer) Clear

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Clear()
```

Clear resets the head and tail pointer to zero.


### func (*RingBuffer) Get

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Get() (byte, bool)
```

Get returns a byte from the buffer. If the buffer is empty,
the method will return a false as the second value.


### func (*RingBuffer) Put

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Put(val byte) bool
```

Put stores a byte in the buffer. If the buffer is already
full, the method will return false.


### func (*RingBuffer) Used

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Used() uint8
```

Used returns how many bytes in buffer have been used.




## type SPI

```go
type SPI struct {
	Bus *sifive.QSPI_Type
}
```

SPI on the FE310. The normal SPI0 is actually a quad-SPI meant for flash, so it is best
to use SPI1 or SPI2 port for most applications.



### func (SPI) Configure

```go
func (spi SPI) Configure(config SPIConfig) error
```

Configure is intended to setup the SPI interface.


### func (SPI) Transfer

```go
func (spi SPI) Transfer(w byte) (byte, error)
```

Transfer writes/reads a single byte using the SPI interface.


### func (SPI) Tx

```go
func (spi SPI) Tx(w, r []byte) error
```

Tx handles read/write operation for SPI interface. Since SPI is a syncronous write/read
interface, there must always be the same number of bytes written as bytes read.
The Tx method knows about this, and offers a few different ways of calling it.

This form sends the bytes in tx buffer, putting the resulting bytes read into the rx buffer.
Note that the tx and rx buffers must be the same size:

	spi.Tx(tx, rx)

This form sends the tx buffer, ignoring the result. Useful for sending "commands" that return zeros
until all the bytes in the command packet have been received:

	spi.Tx(tx, nil)

This form sends zeros, putting the result into the rx buffer. Good for reading a "result packet":

	spi.Tx(nil, rx)




## type SPIConfig

```go
type SPIConfig struct {
	Frequency	uint32
	SCK		Pin
	SDO		Pin
	SDI		Pin
	LSBFirst	bool
	Mode		uint8
}
```

SPIConfig is used to store config info for SPI.





## type UART

```go
type UART struct {
	Bus	*sifive.UART_Type
	Buffer	*RingBuffer
}
```




### func (*UART) Buffered

```go
func (uart *UART) Buffered() int
```

Buffered returns the number of bytes currently stored in the RX buffer.


### func (*UART) Configure

```go
func (uart *UART) Configure(config UARTConfig)
```



### func (*UART) Read

```go
func (uart *UART) Read(data []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Read from the RX buffer.


### func (*UART) ReadByte

```go
func (uart *UART) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```

ReadByte reads a single byte from the RX buffer.
If there is no data in the buffer, returns an error.


### func (*UART) Receive

```go
func (uart *UART) Receive(data byte)
```

Receive handles adding data to the UART's data buffer.
Usually called by the IRQ handler for a machine.


### func (*UART) Write

```go
func (uart *UART) Write(data []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write data to the UART.


### func (*UART) WriteByte

```go
func (uart *UART) WriteByte(c byte)
```





## type UARTConfig

```go
type UARTConfig struct {
	BaudRate	uint32
	TX		Pin
	RX		Pin
}
```

UARTConfig is a struct with which a UART (or similar object) can be
configured. The baud rate is usually respected, but TX and RX may be ignored
depending on the chip and the type of object.





## type UARTParity

```go
type UARTParity uint8
```

UARTParity is the parity setting to be used for UART communication.
