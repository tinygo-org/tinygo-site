## Constants

```go
const Device = deviceName
```

Device is the running program's chip name, such as "ATSAMD51J19A" or
"nrf52840". It is not the same as the CPU name.

The constant is some hardcoded default value if the program does not target a
particular chip but instead runs in WebAssembly for example.


```go
const (
	KHz	= 1000
	MHz	= 1000_000
	GHz	= 1000_000_000
)
```

Generic constants.


```go
const NoPin = Pin(0xff)
```

NoPin explicitly indicates "not a pin". Use this pin if you want to leave one
of the pins in a peripheral unconfigured (if supported by the hardware).


```go
const (
	PinInput	PinMode	= iota
	PinOutput
	PinInputPullup
	PinInputPulldown
)
```



```go
const (
	Mode0	= 0
	Mode1	= 1
	Mode2	= 2
	Mode3	= 3
)
```

SPI phase and polarity configs CPOL and CPHA





## Variables

```go
var (
	ErrTimeoutRNG		= errors.New("machine: RNG Timeout")
	ErrClockRNG		= errors.New("machine: RNG Clock Error")
	ErrSeedRNG		= errors.New("machine: RNG Seed Error")
	ErrInvalidInputPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid input pin")
	ErrInvalidOutputPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid output pin")
	ErrInvalidClockPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid clock pin")
	ErrInvalidDataPin	= errors.New("machine: invalid data pin")
	ErrNoPinChangeChannel	= errors.New("machine: no channel available for pin interrupt")
)
```



```go
var (
	UART0	= &UART{0}
	USB	= &UART{100}
)
```



```go
var Serial = UART0
```

The Serial port always points to the default UART in a simulated environment.

TODO: perhaps this should be a special serial object that outputs via WASI
stdout calls.


```go
var (
	SPI0	= SPI{0}
	I2C0	= &I2C{0}
)
```



```go
var (
	ErrPWMPeriodTooLong = errors.New("pwm: period too long")
)
```



```go
var (
	ErrTxInvalidSliceSize		= errors.New("SPI write and read slices must be same size")
	errSPIInvalidMachineConfig	= errors.New("SPI port was not configured properly by the machine")
)
```

	SampleTime	uint32	// sample time, in microseconds (µs)
}
```

ADCConfig holds ADC configuration parameters. If left unspecified, the zero
value of each parameter will use the peripheral's default settings.





## type I2C

```go
type I2C struct {
	Bus uint8
}
```

I2C is a generic implementation of the Inter-IC communication protocol.



### func (*I2C) Configure

```

SetBaudRate sets the I2C frequency.


### func (*I2C) Tx

```go

	Frequency	uint32
	SCL		Pin
	SDA		Pin
}
```

I2CConfig is used to store config info for I2C.





## type NullSerial

```go
type NullSerial struct {
}
```

NullSerial is a serial version of /dev/null (or null router): it drops
everything that is written to it.



### func (NullSerial) Buffered

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Buffered() int
```

Buffered returns how many bytes are buffered in the UART. It always returns 0
as there are no bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Configure

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Configure(config UARTConfig) error
```

Configure does nothing: the null serial has no configuration.


### func (NullSerial) ReadByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```

ReadByte always returns an error because there aren't any bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Write

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write is a no-op: none of the data is being written and it will not return an
error.


### func (NullSerial) WriteByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) WriteByte(b byte) error
```

WriteByte is a no-op: the null serial doesn't write bytes.




## type PDMConfig

```go
type PDMConfig struct {
	Stereo	bool
	DIN	Pin
	CLK	Pin
}
```






## type PWMConfig

```go
type PWMConfig struct {
	// PWM period in nanosecond. Leaving this zero will pick a reasonable period
	// value for use with LEDs.
	// If you want to configure a frequency instead of a period, you can use the
	// following formula to calculate a period from a frequency:
	//
	//     period = 1e9 / frequency
	//
	Period uint64
}
```

PWMConfig allows setting some configuration while configuring a PWM
peripheral. A zero PWMConfig is ready to use for simple applications such as
dimming LEDs.





## type Pin

```go
type Pin uint8
```

Pin is a single pin on a chip, which may be connected to other hardware
devices. It can either be used directly as GPIO pin or it can be used in
other peripherals like ADC, I2C, etc.



### func (Pin) Configure

```go
func (p Pin) Configure(config PinConfig)
```



### func (Pin) Get

```go
func (p Pin) Get() bool
```



### func (Pin) High

```go
func (p Pin) High()
```

High sets this GPIO pin to high, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to high that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) Low

```go
func (p Pin) Low()
```

Low sets this GPIO pin to low, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to low that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) Set

```go
func (p Pin) Set(value bool)
```





## type PinConfig

```go
type PinConfig struct {
	Mode PinMode
}
```






## type PinMode

```go
type PinMode uint8
```

PinMode sets the direction and pull mode of the pin. For example, PinOutput
sets the pin as an output and PinInputPullup sets the pin as an input with a
pull-up.





## type RingBuffer

```go
type RingBuffer struct {
	rxbuffer	[bufferSize]volatile.Register8
	head		volatile.Register8
	tail		volatile.Register8
}
```

RingBuffer is ring buffer implementation inspired by post at
https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showthread/comp.arch.embedded/77084-1.php



### func (*RingBuffer) Clear

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Clear()
```

Clear resets the head and tail pointer to zero.


### func (*RingBuffer) Get

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Get() (byte, bool)
```

Get returns a byte from the buffer. If the buffer is empty,
the method will return a false as the second value.


### func (*RingBuffer) Put

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Put(val byte) bool
```

Put stores a byte in the buffer. If the buffer is already
full, the method will return false.


### func (*RingBuffer) Used

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Used() uint8
```

Used returns how many bytes in buffer have been used.




## type SPI

```go
type SPI struct {
	Bus uint8
}
```




### func (SPI) Configure

```go
func (spi SPI) Configure(config SPIConfig) error
```



### func (SPI) Transfer

```go
func (spi SPI) Transfer(w byte) (byte, error)
```

Transfer writes/reads a single byte using the SPI interface.


### func (SPI) Tx

```go
func (spi SPI) Tx(w, r []byte) error
```

Tx handles read/write operation for SPI interface. Since SPI is a syncronous write/read
interface, there must always be the same number of bytes written as bytes read.
The Tx method knows about this, and offers a few different ways of calling it.

This form sends the bytes in tx buffer, putting the resulting bytes read into the rx buffer.
Note that the tx and rx buffers must be the same size:

	spi.Tx(tx, rx)

This form sends the tx buffer, ignoring the result. Useful for sending "commands" that return zeros
until all the bytes in the command packet have been received:

	spi.Tx(tx, nil)

This form sends zeros, putting the result into the rx buffer. Good for reading a "result packet":

	spi.Tx(nil, rx)




## type SPIConfig

```go
type SPIConfig struct {
	Frequency	uint32
	SCK		Pin
	SDO		Pin
	SDI		Pin
	Mode		uint8
}
```






## type UART

```go
type UART struct {
	Bus uint8
}
```




### func (*UART) Buffered

```go
func (uart *UART) Buffered() int
```

Buffered returns the number of bytes currently stored in the RX buffer.


### func (*UART) Configure

```go
func (uart *UART) Configure(config UARTConfig)
```

Configure the UART.


### func (*UART) Read

```go
func (uart *UART) Read(data []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Read from the UART.


### func (*UART) ReadByte

```go
func (uart *UART) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```

ReadByte reads a single byte from the UART.


### func (*UART) Write

```go
func (uart *UART) Write(data []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write to the UART.


### func (*UART) WriteByte

```go
func (uart *UART) WriteByte(b byte) error
```

WriteByte writes a single byte to the UART.




## type UARTConfig

```go
type UARTConfig struct {
	BaudRate	uint32
	TX		Pin
	RX		Pin
	RTS		Pin
	CTS		Pin
}
```

UARTConfig is a struct with which a UART (or similar object) can be
configured. The baud rate is usually respected, but TX and RX may be ignored
depending on the chip and the type of object.
