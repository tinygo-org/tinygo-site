## Constants

```go
const HasLowFrequencyCrystal = true
```

The PineTime has a low-frequency (32kHz) crystal oscillator on board.


```go
const (
	LED1	= LCD_BACKLIGHT_HIGH
	LED2	= LCD_BACKLIGHT_MID
	LED3	= LCD_BACKLIGHT_LOW
	LED	= LED1
)
```

LEDs simply expose the three brightness level LEDs on the PineTime. They can
be useful for simple "hello world" style programs.


```go
const (
	UART_TX_PIN	Pin	= NoPin
	UART_RX_PIN	Pin	= NoPin
)
```

The PineTime doesn't have a UART output.
Additionally, leaving the UART on results in a pretty big current drain.


```go
const (
	SPI0_SCK_PIN	Pin	= 2
	SPI0_SDO_PIN	Pin	= 3
	SPI0_SDI_PIN	Pin	= 4
)
```

SPI pins for the PineTime.


```go
const (
	SDA_PIN	Pin	= 6
	SCL_PIN	Pin	= 7
)
```

I2C pins for the PineTime.


```go
const (
	BUTTON_IN	Pin	= 13
	BUTTON_OUT	Pin	= 15
)
```

Button pins. For some reason, there are two pins for the button.


```go
const VIBRATOR_PIN Pin = 16
```

Pin for the vibrator.


```go
const (
	LCD_SCK				= SPI0_SCK_PIN
	LCD_SDI				= SPI0_SDO_PIN
	LCD_RS			Pin	= 18
	LCD_CS			Pin	= 25
	LCD_RESET		Pin	= 26
	LCD_BACKLIGHT_LOW	Pin	= 14
	LCD_BACKLIGHT_MID	Pin	= 22
	LCD_BACKLIGHT_HIGH	Pin	= 23
)
```

LCD pins, using the naming convention of the official docs:
http://files.pine64.org/doc/PineTime/PineTime%20Port%20Assignment%20rev1.0.pdf


```go
const (
	TWI_FREQ_100KHZ	= 100000
	TWI_FREQ_400KHZ	= 400000
)
```

TWI_FREQ is the I2C bus speed. Normally either 100 kHz, or 400 kHz for high-speed bus.

Deprecated: use 100 * machine.KHz or 400 * machine.KHz instead.


```go
const (
	// I2CReceive indicates target has received a message from the controller.
	I2CReceive	I2CTargetEvent	= iota

	// I2CRequest indicates the controller is expecting a message from the target.
	I2CRequest

	// I2CFinish indicates the controller has ended the transaction.
	//
	// I2C controllers can chain multiple receive/request messages without
	// relinquishing the bus by doing 'restarts'.  I2CFinish indicates the
	// bus has been relinquished by an I2C 'stop'.
	I2CFinish
)
```



```go
const (
	// I2CModeController represents an I2C peripheral in controller mode.
	I2CModeController	I2CMode	= iota

	// I2CModeTarget represents an I2C peripheral in target mode.
	I2CModeTarget
)
```



```go
const Device = deviceName
```

Device is the running program's chip name, such as "ATSAMD51J19A" or
"nrf52840". It is not the same as the CPU name.

The constant is some hardcoded default value if the program does not target a
particular chip but instead runs in WebAssembly for example.


```go
const (
	KHz	= 1000
	MHz	= 1000_000
	GHz	= 1000_000_000
)
```

Generic constants.


```go
const NoPin = Pin(0xff)
```

NoPin explicitly indicates "not a pin". Use this pin if you want to leave one
of the pins in a peripheral unconfigured (if supported by the hardware).


```go
const (
	PinInput		PinMode	= (nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_DIR_Input << nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_DIR_Pos) | (nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_INPUT_Connect << nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_INPUT_Pos)
	PinInputPullup		PinMode	= PinInput | (nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_PULL_Pullup << nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_PULL_Pos)
	PinInputPulldown	PinMode	= PinInput | (nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_PULL_Pulldown << nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_PULL_Pos)
	PinOutput		PinMode	= (nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_DIR_Output << nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_DIR_Pos) | (nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_INPUT_Connect << nrf.GPIO_PIN_CNF_INPUT_Pos)
)
```



```go
const (
	PinRising	PinChange	= nrf.GPIOTE_CONFIG_POLARITY_LoToHi
	PinFalling	PinChange	= nrf.GPIOTE_CONFIG_POLARITY_HiToLo
	PinToggle	PinChange	= nrf.GPIOTE_CONFIG_POLARITY_Toggle
)
```

```go
const (
	// ParityNone means to not use any parity checking. This is
	// the most common setting.
	ParityNone	UARTParity	= iota

	// ParityEven means to expect that the total number of 1 bits sent

```go
func CPUReset()
```

CPUReset performs a hard system reset.


### func DeviceID

```go
func DeviceID() []byte
```

DeviceID returns an identifier that is unique within
a particular chipset.

The identity is one burnt into the MCU itself, or the
flash chip at time of manufacture.

It's possible that two different vendors may allocate
the same DeviceID, so callers should take this into
account if needing to generate a globally unique id.

The length of the hardware ID is vendor-specific, but
8 bytes (64 bits) is common.


### func FlashDataEnd

```go
func FlashDataEnd() uintptr
```

Return the end of the writable flash area. Usually this is the address one
past the end of the on-chip flash.


### func FlashDataStart

```go
func FlashDataStart() uintptr
```

Return the start of the writable flash area, aligned on a page boundary. This
is usually just after the program and static data.


### func GetRNG

```go
func GetRNG() (ret uint32, err error)
```

GetRNG returns 32 bits of non-deterministic random data based on internal thermal noise.
According to Nordic's documentation, the random output is suitable for cryptographic purposes.


### func InitADC

	Pin Pin
}
```




### func (ADC) Configure

```go
func (a ADC) Configure(config ADCConfig)
```

Configure configures an ADC pin to be able to read analog data.


### func (ADC) Get

func (a ADC) Get() uint16
```

Get returns the current value of a ADC pin in the range 0..0xffff.




## type ADCConfig

```go
type ADCConfig struct {
	Reference	uint32	// analog reference voltage (AREF) in millivolts
	Resolution	uint32	// number of bits for a single conversion (e.g., 8, 10, 12)
	Samples		uint32	// number of samples for a single conversion (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 32)
	SampleTime	uint32	// sample time, in microseconds (Âµs)
}
```

ADCConfig holds ADC configuration parameters. If left unspecified, the zero
value of each parameter will use the peripheral's default settings.





## type BlockDevice

```go
type BlockDevice interface {
	// ReadAt reads the given number of bytes from the block device.
	io.ReaderAt

	// WriteAt writes the given number of bytes to the block device.
	io.WriterAt

	// Size returns the number of bytes in this block device.
	Size() int64

	// WriteBlockSize returns the block size in which data can be written to
	// memory. It can be used by a client to optimize writes, non-aligned writes
	// should always work correctly.
	WriteBlockSize() int64

	// EraseBlockSize returns the smallest erasable area on this particular chip
	// in bytes. This is used for the block size in EraseBlocks.
	// It must be a power of two, and may be as small as 1. A typical size is 4096.
	EraseBlockSize() int64

	// EraseBlocks erases the given number of blocks. An implementation may
	// transparently coalesce ranges of blocks into larger bundles if the chip
	// supports this. The start and len parameters are in block numbers, use
	// EraseBlockSize to map addresses to blocks.
	EraseBlocks(start, len int64) error
}
```

	mode	I2CMode
}
```

I2C on the NRF51 and NRF52.



### func (*I2C) Configure

```go
func (i2c *I2C) Configure(config I2CConfig) error
```

Configure is intended to setup the I2C interface.


### func (*I2C) ReadRegister

```go
func (i2c *I2C) ReadRegister(address uint8, register uint8, data []byte) error
```

ReadRegister transmits the register, restarts the connection as a read
operation, and reads the response.

Many I2C-compatible devices are organized in terms of registers. This method
is a shortcut to easily read such registers. Also, it only works for devices
with 7-bit addresses, which is the vast majority.


### func (*I2C) SetBaudRate

```go
func (i2c *I2C) SetBaudRate(br uint32) error
```

SetBaudRate sets the I2C frequency. It has the side effect of also
enabling the I2C hardware if disabled beforehand.


### func (*I2C) Tx

```go
func (i2c *I2C) Tx(addr uint16, w, r []byte) (err error)
```

Tx does a single I2C transaction at the specified address.
It clocks out the given address, writes the bytes in w, reads back len(r)
bytes and stores them in r, and generates a stop condition on the bus.


### func (*I2C) WriteRegister

```go
func (i2c *I2C) WriteRegister(address uint8, register uint8, data []byte) error
```

WriteRegister transmits first the register and then the data to the
peripheral device.

Many I2C-compatible devices are organized in terms of registers. This method
is a shortcut to easily write to such registers. Also, it only works for
devices with 7-bit addresses, which is the vast majority.




## type I2CConfig

```go
type I2CConfig struct {
	Frequency	uint32
	SCL		Pin
	SDA		Pin
	Mode		I2CMode
}
```

I2CConfig is used to store config info for I2C.





## type I2CMode

```go
type I2CMode int
```

I2CMode determines if an I2C peripheral is in Controller or Target mode.





## type I2CTargetEvent

```go
type I2CTargetEvent uint8
```

I2CTargetEvent reflects events on the I2C bus





## type NullSerial

```go
type NullSerial struct {
}
```

NullSerial is a serial version of /dev/null (or null router): it drops
everything that is written to it.



### func (NullSerial) Buffered

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Buffered() int
```

Buffered returns how many bytes are buffered in the UART. It always returns 0
as there are no bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Configure

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Configure(config UARTConfig) error
```

Configure does nothing: the null serial has no configuration.


### func (NullSerial) ReadByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```

ReadByte always returns an error because there aren't any bytes to read.


### func (NullSerial) Write

```go
func (ns NullSerial) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write is a no-op: none of the data is being written and it will not return an
error.


### func (NullSerial) WriteByte

```go
func (ns NullSerial) WriteByte(b byte) error
```

WriteByte is a no-op: the null serial doesn't write bytes.




## type PDMConfig

```go
type PDMConfig struct {
	Stereo	bool
	DIN	Pin
	CLK	Pin
}
```






## type PWM

```go
type PWM struct {
	PWM	*nrf.PWM_Type

	channelValues	[4]volatile.Register16
}
```

PWM is one PWM peripheral, which consists of a counter and multiple output
channels (that can be connected to actual pins). You can set the frequency
using SetPeriod, but only for all the channels in this PWM peripheral at
once.



### func (*PWM) Channel

```go
func (pwm *PWM) Channel(pin Pin) (uint8, error)
```

Channel returns a PWM channel for the given pin.


### func (*PWM) Configure

```go
func (pwm *PWM) Configure(config PWMConfig) error
```

Configure enables and configures this PWM.
On the nRF52 series, the maximum period is around 0.26s.


### func (*PWM) Set

```go
func (pwm *PWM) Set(channel uint8, value uint32)
```

Set updates the channel value. This is used to control the channel duty
cycle. For example, to set it to a 25% duty cycle, use:

	ch.Set(ch.Top() / 4)

ch.Set(0) will set the output to low and ch.Set(ch.Top()) will set the output
to high, assuming the output isn't inverted.


### func (*PWM) SetInverting

```go
func (pwm *PWM) SetInverting(channel uint8, inverting bool)
```

SetInverting sets whether to invert the output of this channel.
Without inverting, a 25% duty cycle would mean the output is high for 25% of
the time and low for the rest. Inverting flips the output as if a NOT gate
was placed at the output, meaning that the output would be 25% low and 75%
high with a duty cycle of 25%.


### func (*PWM) SetPeriod

```go
func (pwm *PWM) SetPeriod(period uint64) error
```

SetPeriod updates the period of this PWM peripheral.
To set a particular frequency, use the following formula:

	period = 1e9 / frequency

If you use a period of 0, a period that works well for LEDs will be picked.

SetPeriod will not change the prescaler, but also won't change the current
value in any of the channels. This means that you may need to update the
value for the particular channel.

Note that you cannot pick any arbitrary period after the PWM peripheral has
been configured. If you want to switch between frequencies, pick the lowest
frequency (longest period) once when calling Configure and adjust the
frequency here as needed.


### func (*PWM) Top

```go
func (pwm *PWM) Top() uint32
```

Top returns the current counter top, for use in duty cycle calculation. It
will only change with a call to Configure or SetPeriod, otherwise it is
constant.

The value returned here is hardware dependent. In general, it's best to treat
it as an opaque value that can be divided by some number and passed to
pwm.Set (see pwm.Set for more information).




## type PWMConfig

```go
type PWMConfig struct {
	// PWM period in nanosecond. Leaving this zero will pick a reasonable period
	// value for use with LEDs.
	// If you want to configure a frequency instead of a period, you can use the
	// following formula to calculate a period from a frequency:
	//
	//     period = 1e9 / frequency
	//
	Period uint64
}
```

PWMConfig allows setting some configuration while configuring a PWM
peripheral. A zero PWMConfig is ready to use for simple applications such as
dimming LEDs.





## type Pin

```go
type Pin uint8
```

Pin is a single pin on a chip, which may be connected to other hardware
devices. It can either be used directly as GPIO pin or it can be used in
other peripherals like ADC, I2C, etc.

input or as an output.


### func (Pin) High

```go
func (p Pin) High()
```

High sets this GPIO pin to high, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to high that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) Low

```go
func (p Pin) Low()
```

Low sets this GPIO pin to low, assuming it has been configured as an output
pin. It is hardware dependent (and often undefined) what happens if you set a
pin to low that is not configured as an output pin.


### func (Pin) PortMaskClear

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskClear() (*uint32, uint32)
```

Return the register and mask to disable a given port. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.


### func (Pin) PortMaskSet

```go
func (p Pin) PortMaskSet() (*uint32, uint32)
```

Return the register and mask to enable a given GPIO pin. This can be used to
implement bit-banged drivers.


### func (Pin) Set

```go
func (p Pin) Set(high bool)
```

Set the pin to high or low.
Warning: only use this on an output pin!


### func (Pin) SetInterrupt

```go
func (p Pin) SetInterrupt(change PinChange, callback func(Pin)) error
```

SetInterrupt sets an interrupt to be executed when a particular pin changes
state. The pin should already be configured as an input, including a pull up
or down if no external pull is provided.

This call will replace a previously set callback on this pin. You can pass a
nil func to unset the pin change interrupt. If you do so, the change
parameter is ignored and can be set to any value (such as 0).




## type PinChange

```go
type PinChange uint8
```






## type PinConfig

```go
type PinConfig struct {
	Mode PinMode
}
```






## type PinMode

```go
type PinMode uint8
```

PinMode sets the direction and pull mode of the pin. For example, PinOutput
sets the pin as an output and PinInputPullup sets the pin as an input with a
pull-up.





## type RingBuffer

```go
type RingBuffer struct {
	rxbuffer	[bufferSize]volatile.Register8
	head		volatile.Register8

RingBuffer is ring buffer implementation inspired by post at
https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showthread/comp.arch.embedded/77084-1.php



### func (*RingBuffer) Clear

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Clear()
```

Clear resets the head and tail pointer to zero.


### func (*RingBuffer) Get

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Get() (byte, bool)
```

Get returns a byte from the buffer. If the buffer is empty,
the method will return a false as the second value.


### func (*RingBuffer) Put

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Put(val byte) bool
```

Put stores a byte in the buffer. If the buffer is already
full, the method will return false.


### func (*RingBuffer) Used

```go
func (rb *RingBuffer) Used() uint8
```

Used returns how many bytes in buffer have been used.




## type SPI

```go
type SPI struct {
	Bus	*nrf.SPIM_Type
	buf	*[1]byte	// 1-byte buffer for the Transfer method
}
```

SPI on the NRF.



### func (SPI) Configure

```go
func (spi SPI) Configure(config SPIConfig) error
```

Configure is intended to setup the SPI interface.


### func (SPI) Transfer

```go
func (spi SPI) Transfer(w byte) (byte, error)
```

Transfer writes/reads a single byte using the SPI interface.


### func (SPI) Tx

```go
func (spi SPI) Tx(w, r []byte) error
```

Tx handles read/write operation for SPI interface. Since SPI is a syncronous
write/read interface, there must always be the same number of bytes written
as bytes read. Therefore, if the number of bytes don't match it will be
padded until they fit: if len(w) > len(r) the extra bytes received will be
dropped and if len(w) < len(r) extra 0 bytes will be sent.




## type SPIConfig

```go
type SPIConfig struct {
	Frequency	uint32
	SCK		Pin
	SDO		Pin
	SDI		Pin
	LSBFirst	bool
	Mode		uint8
}
```

SPIConfig is used to store config info for SPI.

This function blocks until the data is finished being sent.




## type UARTConfig

```go
type UARTConfig struct {
	BaudRate	uint32
	TX		Pin
	RX		Pin
	RTS		Pin
	CTS		Pin
}
```

UARTConfig is a struct with which a UART (or similar object) can be
configured. The baud rate is usually respected, but TX and RX may be ignored
depending on the chip and the type of object.
