The [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) is a very small ARM development board based on the Nordic Semiconductor [nrf52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF52840) processor.

This is the same board as [Arduino Nano 33 BLE](nano-33-ble) but with additional onboard sensors (see below).

Flash this board exactly the same way as [Arduino Nano 33 BLE](nano-33-ble) (target name is the same too).

## Additional onboard sensors

* Proximity [APDS9960](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/apds9960)
* Pressure [LPS22HB](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/lps22hb)
* Humidity [HTS221](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/hts221)
* Microphone [MP34DT06JTR](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/microphone)
