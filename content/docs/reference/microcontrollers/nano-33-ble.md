The [Arduino Nano33 BLE](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble) is a very small ARM development board based on the Nordic Semiconductor [nrf52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF52840) processor.

There is also the [Arduino Nano33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) which is the exact same board but with additional onboard sensors.

## Machine Package Docs

[Documentation for the machine package for the Arduino Nano33 BLE](../machine/nano-33-ble)

## Installing BOSSA

In order to flash your TinyGo programs onto the Arduino Nano33 BLE board, you will need to install the "bossac_arduino2" command line utility which is a special build of the [BOSSA command line utilities](https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA).

### macOS

If you have a Mac computer with an Intel processor, download the `bossac_arduino2` program from http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/bossac-1.9.1-arduino2-osx.tar.gz

Extract the downloaded file to a directory on your computer.

Make sure to add that directory into your PATH.

### Linux

Download the `bossac_arduino2` program from http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/bossac-1.9.1-arduino2-linux64.tar.gz

Extract the downloaded file to a directory on your computer.

Make sure to add that directory into your PATH.

### Windows

Download the `bossac_arduino2` program from http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/bossac-1.9.1-arduino2-windows.tar.gz

Extract the downloaded file to a directory on your computer.

Make sure to add that directory into your PATH.

## Flashing

Once you have installed the needed BOSSA command line utility, as in the previous section, you are ready to build and flash code to your Arduino Nano33 BLE board.

### CLI Flashing

- Plug your Arduino Nano33 BLE board into your computer's USB port.
- Build and flash your TinyGo code using the `tinygo flash` command. This command flashes the Arduino Nano33 BLE with the blinky1 example:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=nano-33-ble examples/blinky1
    ```

- The Arduino Nano33 BLE board should restart and then begin running your program.

## Notes

You can use the USB port to the Arduino Nano33 BLE as a serial port. `UART0` refers to this connection.
