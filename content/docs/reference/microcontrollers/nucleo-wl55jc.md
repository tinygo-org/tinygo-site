## Flashing

### OpenOCD

Programs are loaded onto the STM32 Nucleo WL55JC with the onboard STLink hardware programmer, using the `openocd` command line utility program to perform the board flashing. You must install [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/) before you will be able to flash the STM32 Nucleo WL55JC board with your TinyGo code.

- Plug your STM32 Nucleo WL55JC into your computer's USB port.
- Build and flash your TinyGo program using `tinygo flash -target=nucleo-wl55jc`
