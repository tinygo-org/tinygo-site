The [ProductivityOpen P1AM-100](https://facts-engineering.github.io/modules/P1AM-100/P1AM-100.html) automation platform compatible with Productivity1000 Series I/O modules, P1AM Series shields, and Arduino MKR format shields. It is based on the Microchip [SAMD21G18](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMD21G18) family of processors. It also has a NINA-W102 chip onboard which provides an wireless communication abilities based on the popular ESP32 family of wireless chips from Espressif.

## Machine Package Docs

[Documentation for the machine package for the ProductivityOpen P1AM-100](../machine/p1am-100)

## Installing BOSSA

In order to flash your TinyGo programs onto the ProductivityOpen P1AM-100 board, you will need to install the "bossac" command line utility which is part of the [BOSSA command line utilities](https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA).

### macOS

You can use Homebrew to install the BOSSA command line interface by using the following command:

```shell
brew cask install bossa
```

Or if you  prefer, you can also download the installer from https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA/releases/download/1.9.1/bossa-1.9.1.dmg

Once you have downloaded it, double click on the .dmg file to perform the installation.

### Linux

On Linux, install from source:

```shell
sudo apt install libreadline-dev libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev
git clone https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA.git
cd BOSSA
make
sudo cp bin/bossac /usr/local/bin
```

### Windows

You can download BOSSA from https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA/releases/download/1.9.1/bossa-x64-1.9.1.msi

*VERY IMPORTANT*: During the installation, you must choose to install into `c:\Program Files`. The installer might have the wrong path, so edit it to match  `c:\Program Files`.

After the installation, you must add BOSSA to your PATH:

```shell
set PATH=%PATH%;"c:\Program Files\BOSSA";
```

Test that you have installed "BOSSA" correctly by running this command:

```shell
bossac --help
```

## Flashing

Once you have installed the needed BOSSA command line utility, as in the previous section, you are ready to build and flash code to your ProductivityOpen P1AM-100 board.

### CLI Flashing

- Plug your ProductivityOpen P1AM-100 board into your computer's USB port.
- Build and flash your TinyGo code using the `tinygo flash` command. This command flashes the ProductivityOpen P1AM-100 with the blinky1 example:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=p1am-100 examples/blinky1
    ```

- The ProductivityOpen P1AM-100 board should restart and then begin running your program.

### Troubleshooting

If you have troubles getting your ProductivityOpen P1AM-100 board to receive code, try this:

- Press the "RESET" button on the board two times to get the ProductivityOpen P1AM-100 board ready to receive code.
- Now try running the `tinygo flash` command as above:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=p1am-100 [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

Once you have updated your ProductivityOpen P1AM-100 board the first time, after that you should be able to flash it entirely from the command line.

## Notes

You can use the USB port to the ProductivityOpen P1AM-100 as a serial port. `UART0` refers to this connection.

For information on how to use the built-in NINA-W102 wireless chip with the default firmware, please see the "wifinina" driver in the TinyGo drivers repository located at [https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/wifinina](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/wifinina).

You can also use the Espressif ESP-AT firmware, although you will need to flash it yourself. Please see the "espat" driver in the TinyGo drivers repository located at [https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/espat](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/espat).
