## Flashing

There are two options to flash the PCA10031 board.

### OpenOCD (Recommended)

You must install [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/) before you will be able to flash the PCA10031 board with your TinyGo code.
You should check [OpenOCD Documentation](http://openocd.org/Documentation) for installation and configuration instructions.

Once you have installed it correctly, you will be able to flash the PCA10031 board with your TinyGo code.

- Plug your PCA10031 into your computer's USB port.
- Build and flash your TinyGo program using `tinygo flash -target=pca10031`

### nrfjprog/J-Link

Programs can be loaded onto the PCA10031 board using the `nrfjprog` command line utility program.

First install the J-Link Software and Documentation Pack from Segger: [https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)

Then install the nRF5x Command-Line Tools: [https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/tools/nordic_segger.html#nrf5x-command-line-tools-installation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/tools/nordic_segger.html#nrf5x-command-line-tools-installation)

Once you have installed both of these correctly, you will be able to flash the PCA10031 board with your TinyGo code.

- Plug your PCA10031 into your computer's USB port.
- Build and flash your TinyGo program using `tinygo flash -target=pca10031 -programmer command`
