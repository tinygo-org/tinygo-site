## Flashing

### UF2

The PyPortal comes with the [UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2) already installed.

### CLI Flashing

- Plug your PyPortal into your computer's USB port.
- Flash your TinyGo program to the board using this command:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=pyportal [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

- The PyPortal board should restart and then begin running your program.

### Troubleshooting

If you have troubles getting your PyPortal board to receive code, try this:

- Press the "RESET" button on the board two times to get the PyPortal board ready to receive code.
- The PyPortal board will appear to your computer like a USB drive.
- Now try running the command as above:


```shell
tinygo flash -target=pyportal [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
```

Once you have updated your PyPortal board the first time, after that you should be able to flash it entirely from the command line.

## Notes

You can use the USB port to the PyPortal as a serial port. `UART0` refers to this connection.
