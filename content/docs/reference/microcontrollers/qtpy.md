## Flashing

### UF2

The QtPy comes with the [UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2) already installed.

### CLI Flashing

- Plug your QtPy into your computer's USB port.
- Flash your TinyGo program to the board using this command:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=qtpy [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

- The QtPy board should restart and then begin running your program.

### Troubleshooting

If you have troubles getting your QtPy board to receive code, try this:

- Press the "RESET" button on the board two times to get the QtPy board ready to receive code.
- The QtPy board will appear to your computer like a USB drive.
- Now try running the `tinygo flash` command as above:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=qtpy [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

Once you have updated your QtPy board the first time, after that you should be able to flash it entirely from the command line.

## Notes

You can use the USB port to the QtPy as a serial port. `UART0` refers to this connection.
