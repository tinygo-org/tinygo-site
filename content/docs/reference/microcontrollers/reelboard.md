## Flashing

### MSD Flashing

The reel board comes with a bootloader that allows Mass Storage Device (MSD) flashing. This means you can just copy the compiled `.hex` file generated by TinyGo onto it, no additional flashing software is needed.

- Plug your reel board into your computer's USB port.
- The reel board will appear to your computer like a USB drive.
- Build and flash your TinyGo program using `tinygo flash` like this:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=reelboard [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

- The reel board should restart and begin running your program.

### OpenOCD

Programs can also be loaded onto the reelboard using the `openocd` command line utility program. You must install [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/) before you will be able to flash the reelboard with your TinyGo code.

- Plug your reelboard into your computer's USB port.
- Build and flash your TinyGo program using `tinygo flash -target=reelboard`

Bluetooth support is now available for reelboard. See https://github.com/tinygo-org/bluetooth for more information.
