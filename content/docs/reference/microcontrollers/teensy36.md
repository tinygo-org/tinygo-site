## Flashing

### teensy_loader_cli

In order to flash your TinyGo programs onto the Teensy 3.6 board, you will need to install the `teensy_loader_cli` (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/teensy_loader_cli) on your machine.

### CLI Flashing

- Plug your Teensy 3.6 into your computer's USB port.
- Flash your TinyGo program to the board using this command:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=teensy36 [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

- The Teensy 3.6 board should restart and then begin running your program.

### Troubleshooting

If you have troubles getting your Teensy 3.6 board to receive code, try this:

- Press the "RESET" button on the board two times to get the Teensy 3.6 board ready to receive code.
- The Teensy 3.6 board will appear to your computer like a USB drive.
- Now try running the command as above:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=teensy36 [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

Once you have updated your Teensy 3.6 board the first time, after that you should be able to flash it entirely from the command line.

## Notes

You cannot yet use the USB port to the Teensy 3.6 as a USB CDC serial port.
