## Flashing

### UF2

The XIAO BLE comes with the [UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2) already installed.

### CLI Flashing

- Plug your XIAO BLE into your computer's USB port.
- Flash your TinyGo program to the board using this command:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=xiao-ble [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

- The XIAO BLE board should restart and then begin running your program.

## Notes

You can use the USB port to the XIAO BLE as a serial port. `UART0` refers to this connection.
