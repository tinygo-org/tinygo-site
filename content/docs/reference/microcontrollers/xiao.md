## Flashing

### UF2

The XIAO comes with the [UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2) already installed.

### CLI Flashing

- Plug your XIAO into your computer's USB port.
- Flash your TinyGo program to the board using this command:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=xiao [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

- The XIAO board should restart and then begin running your program.

### Troubleshooting

If you have troubles getting your XIAO board to receive code, try this:

- [Short the "RST pins" two times](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/#reset) to get the XIAO board ready to receive code.
- The XIAO board will appear to your computer like a USB drive.
- Now try running the command as above:


```shell
tinygo flash -target=xiao [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
```

Once you have updated your XIAO board the first time, after that you should be able to flash it entirely from the command line.

## Notes

You can use the USB port to the XIAO as a serial port. `UART0` refers to this connection.
