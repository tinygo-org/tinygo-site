To install TinyGo, select the tutorial for your system:

  * [Linux](linux)
  * [macOS](macos)
  * [Windows](windows)
  * [Docker](using-docker)

You can use Docker if that's easier on your system or you would rather try TinyGo in a sandbox but note that it is not as convenient to use as installing TinyGo directly.
