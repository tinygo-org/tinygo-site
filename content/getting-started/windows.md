This page has information on how to install and use TinyGo on Windows 10.

## Quick Install

If you want to use TinyGo to compile your own or sample code, you should be able to install the release version directly on your machine using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) by following the "Quick Install" instructions on the Linux page located [here](./linux).

## Docker Install

The other option is to use the Docker image. This has the benefit of making no changes to your system but has a large download and installation size. For instructions on using the Docker image, please see the page [here](./using-docker).
