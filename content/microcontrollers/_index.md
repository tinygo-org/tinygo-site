# Go on microcontrollers

TinyGo lets you run Go directly on microcontrollers.

TinyGo has support for 46 different boards and devices such as the Arduino Nano33 IoT, Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, BBC micro:bit and more. Click on a board name found in the left menu to see the what features are supported for the given hardware.

We also give you the ability to add new boards. If your target isn't listed here, please raise an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/issues).

Want to know the details about how it is possible to compile Go for microcontrollers? Check out the [microcontrollers](../compiler-internals/microcontrollers/) page in our "Compiler Internals" section.
