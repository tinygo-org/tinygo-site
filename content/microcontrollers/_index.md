# Go on microcontrollers

TinyGo lets you run Go directly on microcontrollers.

TinyGo has support for 15 different boards such as the Arduino Nano33 IoT, Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, and BBC micro:bit. Click to see the supported hardware.

We also give you the ability to add new boards. If your target isn't listed here, please raise an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/issues).

Want to know the details about how it is possible to compile Go for microcontrollers? Check out the [microcontrollers](../compiler-internals/microcontrollers/) page in our "Compiler Internals" section.
