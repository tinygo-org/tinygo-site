The [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) is small ARM development board based on the Atmel [SAMD21](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMD21G18) family of processors. It has several built-in devices such as WS2812 "NeoPixel" LEDs, buttons, an accelerometer, and some other sensors.

## Interfaces

| UART      | YES | YES |
| SPI      | YES | YES |
| I2C      | YES | YES |
| ADC      | YES | YES |
| PWM      | YES | YES |

## Flashing

### UF2

The Circuit Playground Express comes with the [UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2) already installed.

- Plug your Circuit Playground Express into your computer's USB port.
- Press the "RESET" button on the board two times to get the Circuit Playground Express board ready to receive code.
- The Circuit Playground Express board will appear to your computer like a USB drive. Determine the path to the board, for example on Linux it will be something like `/media/[USERNAME]/[NAME OF THE BOARD]`.
- Build your TinyGo program to the board in `.uf2` format using the `tinygo build -o=/media/[USERNAME]/[NAME OF THE BOARD]/flash.uf2 -target=circuitplay-express [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]` command.
- The Circuit Playground Express board should restart and then begin running your program.

### CLI Flashing

Once you have updated your Circuit Playground Express board the first time, after that you should be able to flash it entirely from the command line using the `stty` command like this:

```
stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 1200 hupcl; tinygo build -o=/media/[USERNAME]/[NAME OF THE BOARD]/flash.uf2 -target=circuitplay-express [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
```

Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` in the command above with the correct USB port name for your board.

The Circuit Playground Express board should restart and then begin running your program.

## Notes

You can use the USB port to the Circuit Playground Express as a serial port. `UART0` refers to this connection.

For an example that uses the built-in Neopixel LEDs, take a look at the TinyGo drivers repository located at [https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers)
