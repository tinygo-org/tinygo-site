## Flashing

### UF2

The Feather M4 comes with the [UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2) already installed.

### CLI Flashing on Linux

- Plug your Feather M4 into your computer's USB port.
- Flash your TinyGo program to the board using this command:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=feather-m4 [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

- The Feather M4 board should restart and then begin running your program.

### CLI Flashing on macOS

In order to talk to flash the board using macOS, you need to discover how macOS system has named the serial port.

- Plug your Feather M0 into your computer's USB port.
- Run this command to display the connected USB devices:

    ```shell
    ls /dev | grep usb
    ```

    The above command should result in output like this:

    ```shell
    /dev/cu.usbmodem141201
    /dev/tty.usbmodem141201
    ```

- Using this information, you should now be able to flash your TinyGo program to the board using this command:

    ```shell
    tinygo flash -target=feather-m4 -port=[PORT TO YOUR BOARD] [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
    ```

    Replace `[PORT TO YOUR BOARD]` in the command above with the correct USB port name for your board.

- The Feather M4 board should restart and then begin running your program.

### Troubleshooting

If you have troubles getting your Feather M4 board to receive code, try this:

- Press the "RESET" button on the board two times to get the Feather M0 board ready to receive code.
- The Feather M0 board will appear to your computer like a USB drive.
- Now try running the command as above:


```shell
tinygo flash -target=feather-m4 [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
```

Once you have updated your Feather M4 board the first time, after that you should be able to flash it entirely from the command line.

## Notes

You can use the USB port to the Feather M4 as a serial port. `UART0` refers to this connection.
