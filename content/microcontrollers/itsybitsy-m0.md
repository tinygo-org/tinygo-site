## Flashing

### UF2

The ItsyBitsy M0 comes with the [UF2 bootloader](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2) already installed.

- Plug your ItsyBitsy M0 into your computer's USB port.
- Press the "RESET" button on the board two times to get the ItsyBitsy M0 board ready to receive code.
- The ItsyBitsy M0 board will appear to your computer like a USB drive. Determine the path to the board, for example on Linux it will be something like `/media/[USERNAME]/[NAME OF THE BOARD]`.
- Build your TinyGo program to the board in `.uf2` format using the `tinygo build -o=/media/[USERNAME]/[NAME OF THE BOARD]/flash.uf2 -target=itsybitsy-m0 [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]` command.
- The ItsyBitsy M0 board should restart and then begin running your program.

### CLI Flashing

Once you have updated your ItsyBitsy M0 board the first time, after that you should be able to flash it entirely from the command line using the `stty` command like this:

```
stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 1200 hupcl; tinygo build -o=/media/[USERNAME]/[NAME OF THE BOARD]/flash.uf2 -target=itsybitsy-m0 [PATH TO YOUR PROGRAM]
```

Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` in the command above with the correct USB port name for your board.

The ItsyBitsy M0 board should restart and then begin running your program.
