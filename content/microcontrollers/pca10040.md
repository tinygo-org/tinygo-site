## Flashing

### nrfjprog/J-Link

Programs are loaded onto the pca10040 board using the `nrfjprog` command line utility program.

First install the J-Link Software and Documentation Pack from Segger: [https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)

Then install the nRF5x Command-Line Tools: [https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/tools/nordic_segger.html#nordic-segger](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/tools/nordic_segger.html#nordic-segger)

Once you have installed both of these correctly, you will be able to flash the pca10040 board with your TinyGo code.

- Plug your pca10040 into your computer's USB port.
- Build and flash your TinyGo program using `tinygo flash -target=pca10040`
